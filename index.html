            Canals, reservoirs and 3,000 parks all make cycling in London an absolute joy. As the famous River Thames cuts through the centre, 
            it is easy to enjoy flat bike rides throughout the city. Gentle hills can also be found here though, 
            offering rare chances for views across the capital.

            It might be the most populated city in the country but you will find plenty of cycle routes throughout London and its leafy suburbs. 
            From Richmond Park to Hampstead Heath, it is easy to get out for a spin and find yourself in surprisingly wild nature.

                <p>
                There's nothing worse than being squeezed into a 
                tourist bus to see London's renowned landmarks - 
                especially when the alternative is to hop on a bike
                , take in the sights at your own pace and stop 
                somewhere for lunch or coffee. Starting at 
                Battersea Park, popular with joggers, pedestrians, 
                and cyclists, this medium difficulty route takes 
                you on 16.6km through some of the city's most 
                famous highlights.

                    Want to escape the hustle and bustle 
                    of south London without leaving the city? 
                    Experience part of the National Cycle Network 
                    Route 20 by following the Wandle River from Wandsworth 
                    through Sutton and Merton to Croydon. The route is a 
                    mostly traffic-free gravel route with more than ten 
                    parks and green spaces along the path - perfect for 
                    taking leisurely breaks and enjoying the peaceful scenery.

                    Starting on Park Lane, close to the Marble Arch, 
                    you can rent a bike from Santander, London's public
                    bike-sharing program, for £2 to access the bikes 
                    for 24 hours. The first 30 minutes are free, and 
                    £2 for every 30 minutes after that.
                    Start anti-clockwise and cycle through 
                    the Italian gardens, then zip past Kensington 
                    Palace, the Royal Albert Hall and the Albert 
                    Memorial.
